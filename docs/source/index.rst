Welcome to ExplainPolySVM!
============================================

ExplainPolySVM is a python module for feature importance and selection for SVM models trained using the polynomial
kernel. It provides an explainable version of a trained SVM model by converting the model into a compressed linear
version of the polynomial transformation. It is built closely connected to the Scikit-learn Support Vector Classifier
but can be used with any set of SVM model parts.
